# Problem Statement
Given is a point (x1,…,xN) in an N-dimensional space.

Find the Manhattan distance, Euclidian distance, and Chebyshev distance between this point and the origin. Here, each of them is defined as follows:
- The Manhattan distance: \`|x1| + … + |xN|\`

- The Euclidian distance: ![euclidean distance](https://bit.ly/2TsS7Fx)    

- The Chebyshev distance: \`max(|x1|, ..., |xn|)\`

Note: Define a separate function for each distance and make it return the value.
## Output
Print the Manhattan distance, Euclidian distance, and Chebyshev distance between the given point and the origin, each in its own line. Each value in your print will be acceptedwhen its absolute or relative error from the correct value is at most 10^−9.

Given are integers 
a, b, c and d. If x and y are integers and a ≤ x ≤ b and c ≤ y ≤ d hold, what is the maximum possible value of x × y

# Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
\`a b c d\`
# Output
Return the answer.

# Sample Input
\`[1, 2, 1, 1]\`
# Sample Output
\`2\`

If x = 1 and y = 1 then x × y = 1. If x = 2 and y = 1 then x × y = 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.

# Sample Input 2
\`[3, 5, -4, -2]\`
# Sample Output 2
\`-6\`

The answer can be negative.

Kevin and Stuart want to play the ***'The Minion Game'***.
#### Game Rules

Both players are given the same string, ***S***.
Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string ***S***.
Stuart has to make words starting with consonants.
Kevin has to make words starting with vowels.
The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings.

#### Scoring 
A player gets +1 point for each occurrence of the substring in the string ***S***.


**For Example**


String ***S*** = BANANA
Kevin's vowel beginning word = ANA
Here, ANA occurs twice in BANANA. Hence, Kevin will get 2 Points.
For better understanding, see the image below:

![Example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/9693/1450330231-04db904008-banana.png)


Your task is to determine the winner of the game and their score.
###### Input Format
A single line of input containing the string ***S***.
**Note**: The string ***S*** will contain only uppercase letters: \`[ A- Z ]\`

**Constriants**

0 < *len(S)* <= 10^6

###### Output Format

Print one line: the name of the winner and their score separated by a space.

If the game is a draw, print Draw.

##### Sample Input
\`\`\`bash
    BANANA
\`\`\`

##### Sample Output
\`\`\`bash
    Stuart 12

Notes:
Vowels are only defined as *AEIOU*. In this problem, *Y* is not considered a vowel.
